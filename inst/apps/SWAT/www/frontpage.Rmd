# Welcome to the Shortened Web Link Analysis Tool (SWAT)!

This tool is designed to allow analysts to upload .csv files
containing Shortened Web Link Data to conduct analysis
on the shortened web links. This app is divided into a number
of tabs located at the top of the browser screen which are
intended to be navigated to sequentially. 

## Load Data

On this tab is the file input box. The user will select a 
file from their computer for uploading. The file must contain the following column names:

* AUTHORITY_URI_REFERRER
* AUTHORITY_URI
* referrer
* VENDORNAME_OPERATINGSYSTEM
* TYPE_HARDWAREPLATFORM
* TIMESTAMP_INIT
* DURATION_FROMCLICKTOCREATION

The maximum file size is currently 500MB. After selecting a file, the user will
select `"Upload and Clean Data"`. After clicking this button,
the app will import the data and generate a data table
(similar to an excel spreadsheet) of the uploaded dataset.
Here, the user can search for terms contained in the data or
can sort the columns to see and get a better feeling of the
data. 

## Exploratory Data Analysis

This tab generates bar charts and time density plots based on
user input for building the chart. If  the user selects:

* referrer
* VENDORNAME_OPERATINGSYSTEM
* TYPE_HARDWAREPLATFORM

The app will build the associated bar chart. The user can also
choose to build a bar chart to find an associated breakdown
by changing the fill option. 
If the user selects:

* DURATION_FROMCLICKTOCREATION
* TIME_CLICKED

a time-density plot will be generated. This density plot shows
the distribution of either link ages (DURATION_FROMCLICKTOCREATION)
or when users actually clicked on the link (TIME_CLICKED). 
Creation indicates the time that the link shortening service first
generated that shortened link. A final functionality on this tab
is the ability to filter low occurring values. This allows the
user to focus on the most occurring entities and also generating
a nicely formatted chart. The link age density chart can also
filter out old ages between 1 day and 3 days.

## Community Detection

This tab conducts the market basket analysis on the dataset.
After clicking the conduct community detection, the app will
build the co-user matrix (a matrix that connects web domains
to other web domains by common users). It will then build the
graph and conduct community detection after applying an iterative filter.
At each step of the filtering, the modularity of the graph is calculated.
The community structure that generates the greatest modularity
is the preferred filter level. The second plot informs the user
as to how many domains were filtered out of the data set to
generate the detected communities.

## Community Domains

This tab allows the user to identify how many web domains are
in each identified cluster. These web domain clusters indicate
which web domains were most commonly accessed together. 
Finally, a table can be generated showing which web domains are
in the selected cluster and how many total clicks were directed
to those web domains. 

## Plots by Community

This tab generates bar charts and time density plots based on
user input for building the chart. If  the user selects:

* Referrer
* OperatingSystem
* HardwarePlatform

The app will build the associated bar chart. 

If the user selects:

* TimeClicked
* DurationFromClickToCreation

a time-density plot will be generated. This density plot shows
the distribution of either link ages (DurationFromClickToCreation)
or when users actually clicked on the link (TimeClicked). 
Creation indicates the time that the link shortening service first
generated that shortened link. A final functionality on this tab
is the ability to change the filter associated with the co-user matrix
and the number of communities. The user can determine the optimal co-user matrix filter 
level from the community detection tab and the number of communities from 
the community domains tab.
